## Project description

Driftchat is an app, where you can match with random people for chatting over video and text. Driftchat can be summed up with "Omegle for mobile". The app has three main screens which can be navigated by left/right swipes.

### About screen

The left-most screen, where information about the user is displayed, which includes information like their **name**, **favorite hobbies**, **description** about themselves and a **quote** the user relates with. On the top-left corner there is a button which toggles between **light/dark** themes.

### Profile Creation screen

The main screen the app opens into, it's the main intersection of the app, where a left swipe takes the user to the **About** screen and a right swipe takes the user to the **Chatroom** screen. Here the user can build their profile which is displayed on the **About** screen. Driftchat is not strict on user creation, and uses that information to match people with similar interests and preferences.

### Chatroom screen

The right-most screen where all the magic happens. When the user swipes to this screen, they are placed inside a waiting lobby, which is indicated by a loading circle. When Driftchat sees another person inside the waiting lobby, it matches those two people and places them inside a chatroom. Inside the chatroom, the users camera feed is displayed on the top-right corner and their matched persons camera feed takes up the whole screen. The two matched users can now communicate through video and chat. When one of the users wants to match with a new person, they can swipe right, and the app places them back inside the waiting lobby where it tries to find the user a new match.
