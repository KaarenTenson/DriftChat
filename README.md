Team DriftChat: Ander Saarniit, Kaaren Tenson, Tristan Laur, Raivo Rander.

We will make an app, where you can chat with other people live over facetime like features. When opening the app it will show you your profile, where you can: choose your screen name, hobby,
tell more about youself, put an age range, choose what gender people you want to talk to, choose the language you want to talk in and finally answer some fun questions about yourself. 
And hop in the video call. If you don't want to talk with them you can send text messages. You can also see what the other person has answered their profile questions.
If the person seems boring/uninterested you can swipe right and go to another person and the app will choose you another random person from the pool.
